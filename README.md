## Welcome to Rusty / Dusty World
You might think I am crazy, so I am, maybe not, but this is my first Rusty project commited tonight. 
This project so, reminds my of my first Hello world in ANSI C, with one difference, the C took me at least 2 hours to debug and see what I missed and usally it was "conio.h" :D or capital "Studio.io".
