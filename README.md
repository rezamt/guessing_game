## Welcome to Rusty / Dusty World
You might think I am crazy, so I am, maybe not, but this is my first Rusty project commited tonight. 
This project so, reminds my of my first Hello world in ANSI C, with one difference, the C took me at least 2 hours to debug and see what I missed and usally it was "conio.h" :D or capital "Studio.h".




Looking for somewhere to begin, install Rusty first, 

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

```



then hack the following site: 

```
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch01-00-introduction.html

```

And finally don't forget to share your experience with your other Crazy friends. LOL
